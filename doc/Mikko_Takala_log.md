| 15.03.2022 | 11:30 - ~14   | 3h    | Work log base, reading the instruction PDF                                                                                                                                                           |
| 16.03.2022 | 10:30 - 13:00 | 2.5h  | Started a 2D project in Godot. Reading Godot docs, added a TileMap to the project. Configuring tilemap                                                                                               |
|            | 17:30 - 18:00 | 0.5h  | Reading Godot docs                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|            | 19:00 - 21:00 | 2h    | Reading Godot docs, added parallax background image                                                                                                                                                  |
| 17.03.2022 | 11:30 - 14:30 | 3h    | Went on a tangent to write a Java program that can read images and mirror them horizontally and glue the original and the mirrored part together to easily create parallax backgrounds with no seams |
| 18.03.2022 | 09:30 - 10:30 | 1h    | Added a temporary 2D player character and added movement and collision to it                                                                                                                         |
| 22.03.2022 | 16:00 - 17:30 | 1.5 h | Tweaking project setting in Godot, adding base scenes for level goals and collectable items. Player character can now jump and it's movement has a slowdown effect                                   |
| 29.03.2022 | 12:00 - 14:00 | 2h    | Adding collectable items to the game                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 31.03.2022 | 11:25 - 12:00 | 0.5h  | Adding a camera that follows the player character                                                                                                                                                    |
| 23.04.2022 | 15:00 - 18:00 | 3h    | Added HUD and signals for scores from collectable items. Made the Main node's script responsible for game mechanics, by listening and reacting to the signals there                                  |
| 24.04.2022 | 10:00 - 12:30 | 2.5h    | Added signal for map Goal. Main listens to Goal signal for Player entry and removes current level and loads the next one if current wasn't the last level. Created a second level that gets loaded after the Player reaches GoalArea in the first level. Made the first level also dynamically loaded instead of 'hardcoded' to the scene tree.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 24.04.2022 | 13:30 - 15:00 | 1.5h | Added restriction so Player has to collect all coins in a level in order to use the goal to start the next level. Level indicator now updates correctly and score indicator shows how many coins there are available in the level. |
| 30.04.2022 | 09:00 - 10:30 | 1.5h | Added startscreen and after some issues got the Player character and level hidden until user clicks the "Start" button on the UI |
| 30.04.2022 | 12:00 - 13:30 | 1.5h | Moved Camera to be a child of the Player character and re-configured it's limits. Trying to get a signal when Player goes out of the screen to enable a 'game over' condition. Signal of Player exiting screen eg. "dying" is now connected and the game resets and returns to the start screen where player can restart game from first level by pressing the start button. |
| 02.05.2022 | 19:30 - 20:30 | 1h | Added a flag sprite to the goals to make them actually visible. Tried to make first level a little more playable. |
| 03.05.2022 | 20:00 - 21:00 | 1h | Adding enemies to the game, they don't move yet, but when Player collides with them, we trigger 'game over'. I'm not sure if the collision detection is used in the best possible way, since for some reason the Area2D that is only intended to collide with the Enemy layer, also triggers on ground tiles, so the collidin body has to be checked to react correctly. |
| 04.05.2022 | 20:00 - 21:30 | 1.5h | Start adding a weapon for player to shoot the enemies. The player can now spawn bullets that travel to the point in the game world the player clicked. It was the intention to make the bullets go on after the clicked point by scaling the vector given to the "move towards" function, but for some reason scaling the vector alters it's course. Need to figure out why. |
| 05.05.2022 | 20:00 - 21:00 | 1h | Managed to fix the bullet trajectory. Bullets now continue indefinitely to the direction the player fires them. Direction is determined by current position of mouse pointer when player fires. TODO: Make sure to kill bullet objects either after a certain time, or after they are out of camera. (NOTE: out of camera deletion disables shooting unseen enemies) Also made Level1 less annoying to play. |
| 07.05.2022 | 10:50 - 12:30 | 1.5h | Making the bullets better: add collision to level materials and enemies, add effect when hitting enemies (enemy disappears, bullets disappear on all collisions). |
| 07.05.2022 | 20:30 - 20:45 | 0.25h | A text message is shown to Player when they die instead of just making the level disappear and showing start button. |
| 08.05.2022 | 10:15 - 11:00 | 0.75h | Added an animation to the player when it walks. Animation starts on movement key press, and ends when player velocity on the x-axis reaches 0. Animation now also runs to the end instead of leaving the character in a weird pose in the middle of the animation. Best would be a reset of the animation or something, becaues now the animation sometimes takes "too long" to finish when player has already been stopped, but have to figure that out later.|
| 15.05.2022 | 17:30 - 21:30 | h | Trying to make last level detection dynamic based on the filenames in the project repository. The script should count the "LevelX.tscn" files to determine this. Somehow the game crashes after restarting after death when player tries to shoot. Makes no sense as shooting works when game is initially started, and there should be no difference in how the level is loaded at first start and at restart. Anyway, does not work. |
