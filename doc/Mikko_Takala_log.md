| 16.03.2022 | 10:30 - 13:00 | 2.5h  | Started a 2D project in Godot. Reading Godot docs, added a TileMap to the project. Configuring tilemap                                                                                               |
|            | 17:30 - 18:00 | 0.5h  | Reading Godot docs                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|            | 19:00 - 21:00 | 2h    | Reading Godot docs, added parallax background image                                                                                                                                                  |
| 17.03.2022 | 11:30 - 14:30 | 3h    | Went on a tangent to write a Java program that can read images and mirror them horizontally and glue the original and the mirrored part together to easily create parallax backgrounds with no seams |
| 18.03.2022 | 09:30 - 10:30 | 1h    | Added a temporary 2D player character and added movement and collision to it                                                                                                                         |
| 22.03.2022 | 16:00 - 17:30 | 1.5 h | Tweaking project setting in Godot, adding base scenes for level goals and collectable items. Player character can now jump and it's movement has a slowdown effect                                   |
| 29.03.2022 | 12:00 - 14:00 | 2h    | Adding collectable items to the game                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 31.03.2022 | 11:25 - 12:00 | 0.5h  | Adding a camera that follows the player character                                                                                                                                                    |
| 23.04.2022 | 15:00 - 18:00 | 3h    | Added HUD and signals for scores from collectable items. Made the Main node's script responsible for game mechanics, by listening and reacting to the signals there                                  |
| 24.04.2022 | 10:00 - 12:30 | 2.5h    | Added signal for map Goal. Main listens to Goal signal for Player entry and removes current level and loads the next one if current wasn't the last level. Created a second level that gets loaded after the Player reaches GoalArea in the first level. Made the first level also dynamically loaded instead of 'hardcoded' to the scene tree.                                                                                                                                                                            |
